## Description
* Pig-Dice is a web game designed to enable users have fun as they play either between themselves or versus the computer.
* The die values have been instructed in the JavaScript console to display random numbers from 1 to 6.
* When one rolls their dice and gets the same value from each die, they get to play again.
* When playing versus the computer, should both players have same die values for each pair, no winner is declared and the round is played again.
* In the versus computer mode when the user rolls their die, the game is developed such that the computer die values are displayed right after showing those of the user and by comparing these dice values, a winner is declared.
